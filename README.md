# Face Mask Detection

## Introduction

COVID-19 is a contagious disease caused due to a virus, which appears to spread from one person to another person through close contact. This outbreak in todayâ€™s world has very disastrous effects, which may sometimes lead to the death of a person. To protect oneself and save the lives of others, it is necessary to put on a mask in public places. To avoid the spread of disease in public places, a two-phase deep learning face detector model is built to detect face masks. The first phase consists of training the neural model using the image dataset and the second phase will be capturing real-time video from the camera and then detecting if the person is wearing a mask or not.

Author Jason et al, proposed a dual-stage CNN architecture for the face mask detection [1].  The first stage of architecture detects humans face using RetinaFace model, which resulted better when compared to Dlib DNN and MTCNN models. The second stage classifies faces as masked or unmasked using NASNetMobile model after comparing its performance with DenseNet121 and MobileNetV2. The system exhibited greater performance and has ability to identify multiple face masks in the image. This system can further be extended to port to machine learning models to its TensorFlow Lite versions. In the experiments conducted by Toshanlal et al. [2] in generating accurate face segmentation masks from any size of input image, predefined training weights of VGG-16 architecture is used to extract the features and make predictions. This fully convolution networks (FCN) consist of 17 convolutional layers and 5 max pooling layers. The system shows the identified faces withing bounding circle with respect to pixel level accuracy. Also, refined predicted masks are shown after they are subjected to post processing. The proposed FCN model separates facial spatial location along with a particular label. The post processing for detecting facial masks given greater boost to a mean pixel level accuracy. This system can identify both non frontal and multiple faces from single image, which can find its advanced implications in detecting facial part. 

A hybrid deep transfer learning model with machine learning models is built to detect face mask [3]. The first part is designed using Resnet50 for feature extraction. The second component is designed using classical machine learning classifiers such as decision trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and ensemble learning for classifying the face masks as with mask or without mask. Three algorithms are used to make comparison and find the best suitable algorithm with highest accuracy and consumed less time in training and detection processes. The authors achieved the highest accuracy with the least time consumed in the training process with SVM classifier. The SVM classifier in Real-World Masked Face Dataset (RMFD) resulted higher testing accuracy. In Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD), classifier obtained comparatively less, while in Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset, it resulted the highest testing accuracy. In future, neutrosophic domain can used in classifying and detecting tasks. In [4], Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is implemented for facial feature extraction in detecting masked and non-masked faces. The study showed face without mask gave better recognition rate, while for masked face gave poor. It is concluded that feature extraction using PCA for masked face is not effective than non-masked face.

## Selected Dataset

Face Mask Dataset is taken from the Kaggle site. The dataset consists of images of people with mask or without mask. It has around 12,000 images. The images are grouped into test, train, and validation folders. Each folder contains images which are further grouped into WithMask and WithoutMask.
